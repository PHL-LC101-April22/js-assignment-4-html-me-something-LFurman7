               <h2>It Was All A Dream...</h2>
               <p>
                  Since I was a small child, being a mom has been a life-long dream of mine. That feeling of having a family of my own and creating that network of love and comfort played a major role in way I shaped my life.
                  Though I had planned for later, becoming a mom at 24, seemed right. My career life was easy going enough to create balance, we had the love and support of close family and friends, and baby was healthy; life was good.

                  Growing up, I was known as the "Wild Child", full of energy, quick to jump into something and full of ideas. All great things really, but after my youngest was born, it seemed as though the "baby-brain" I had been fighting since his brother's birth.... wasn't really getting any better.
                  I was generally known to be forgetful (Keys and cash tended to be the biggest downfall lol), but something was off and my spirit was unsettled. This was more than just the usual "brain drain" issues I had faced previously. But, being told that this was a normal thing and it would pass, I pushed it to the back and rolled with the tide of things.
